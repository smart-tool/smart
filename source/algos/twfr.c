/*
 *	ALGORITHM Weak Factor Recognizer, Tuned Version, (TWFR)
 *  By Simone Faro, Domenico Cantone and Arianna Pavone
 *
 * PREPROCESSING:
 *		an hash value is computed for al factors of the pattern with
 *length in [1..16] the computed hash value is always a number in [0...256*256]
 *		if w is a factor of x, and hash(w) is its hash value, than
 *F[hash(w)]=TRUE, otherwise F[hash(w)]=FALSE SEARCHING The algorithm searches
 *for factors of the pattern using a weak recognition method the search phase is
 *very similar to BOM. The window is scanned right to left and for each
 *character a new hash value of the suffix of the window is computed. Let w be
 *the suffix we scanned. If F[hash(w)]=TRUE we continue scanning the next
 *character of the window. Otherwise we stop scanning (w is not a factor of the
 *pattern) and jump to the right, like in BOM.
