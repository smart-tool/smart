Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about one million dollars for each hour we work.  One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce a
million dollars per hour; next year we will have to do four text
files per month, thus upping our productivity to two million/hr.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers.

****START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START****

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT

By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext,
you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept this
"Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive a
refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by sending
a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person you got
it from.  If you received this etext on a physical medium (such
as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the
"Project").  Among other things, this means that no one owns a
United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special
rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute
this etext under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts
to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.
Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they
may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other things, Defects
may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium,
a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be
read by your equipment.

DISCLAIMER

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this etext
from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all liability to
you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees, and
[2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILI-
TY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you
paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that time to
the person you received it from.  If you received it on a
physical medium, you must return it with your note, and such
person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement copy.
If you received it electronically, such person may choose to
alternatively give you a second opportunity to receive it elec-
tronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY

You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise from any

from [1] any alteration, modification or addition to the etext
for which you are responsible, or [2] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by

     quires that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or
     this "small print!" statement.  You may however, if you
     wish, distribute this etext in machine readable binary,
     compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form, including any
     form resulting from conversion by word processing or hyper-
     text software, but only so long as *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable.  We
          consider an etext *not* clearly readable if it
          contains characters other than those intended by the
          author of the work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*)
          and underline (_) characters may be used to convey
          punctuation intended by the author, and additional
          characters may be used to indicate hypertext links.

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no
          expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form
          by the program that displays the etext (as is the
          case, for instance, with most word processors).

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no
          additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext
          in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC or

          obligation to charge money or earn profits for your
          distribution.

     [*]  Shall be paid to "Project Gutenberg Association /
          Illinois Benedictine College" (or to such other person
          as the Project Gutenberg Association may direct)

:Afghanistan Economy

Overview:
    Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
    dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
    goats). Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including
    the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
    1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,
    with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3
    million. Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan. Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product
    is lower than 12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
    disruption of trade and transport.
GDP:

    (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

    hides, and pelts
  partners:
    mostly former USSR
Imports:
    $874 million (c.i.f., FY91 est.)
  commodities:
    food and petroleum products
  partners:
    mostly former USSR
External debt:
    $2.3 billion (March 1991 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 2.3% (FY91 est.); accounts for about 25% of GDP
Electricity:
    480,000 kW capacity; 1,450 million kWh produced, 90 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, and
    cement; handwoven carpets; natural gas, oil, coal, copper
Agriculture:
    largely subsistence farming and nomadic animal husbandry; cash products -
    wheat, fruits, nuts, karakul pelts, wool, mutton
Illicit drugs:
    an illicit producer of opium poppy and cannabis for the international drug
    trade; world's second-largest opium producer (after Burma) and a major
    source of hashish

    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $380 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $510 million; OPEC
    bilateral aid (1979-89), $57 million; Communist countries (1970-89), $4.1
    billion; net official Western disbursements (1985-89), $270 million

Exchange rates:
    afghanis (Af) per US$1 - 550 (May 1992, free market exchange rate), 900
    (free market exchange rate as of November 1991), 850 (1991), 700 (1989-90),
    220 (1988-89); note - these rates reflect the bazaar rates rather than the
    official exchange rates

:Albania Economy

Overview:
    The Albanian economy, already providing the lowest standard of living in
    Europe, contracted sharply in 1991, with most industries producing at only a
    fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40%. For over
    40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the principle of
    central planning and state ownership of the means of production. Albania
    began fitful economic reforms during 1991, including the liberalization of
    prices and trade, the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform.
    These reform measures were crippled, however, by the widespread civil
    disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state. Following
    their overwhelming victory in the 22 March 1991 elections, the new
    Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the
    economy and establish a market economy. In an effort to expand international
    ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet
    Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank. The Albanians have
    also passed legislation allowing foreign investment. Albania possesses
    considerable mineral resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient
    in food; however, the breakup of cooperative farms in 1991 and general
    economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
    supplies. Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary
    and subject to an especially wide margin of error.

:Algeria Economy

Overview:
    The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy. Algeria
    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts, about 30% of
    government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
    program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
    mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
    1988. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including
    privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector
    activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major
    overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only
    limited progress.

:Andorra Economy

Overview:
    The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
    summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,
    cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.

:Angola Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
    population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
    to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. In recent years, a bitter
    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy.

:Antarctica Geography

Total area:
    14,000,000 km2 (est.)
Land area:
    about 14,000,000 km2
Comparative area:
    slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US; second-smallest continent
    (after Australia)
Land boundaries:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Coastline:
    17,968 km
Maritime claims:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Disputes:
    Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
    sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
    (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and
    UK; the US and Russia do not recognize the territorial claims of other
    nations and have made no claims themselves (but reserve the right to do so);
    no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90. west and 150.
    west, where, because of floating ice, Antarctica is unapproachable from the
    sea
Climate:
    severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
    ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
    elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
    temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
    freezing
Terrain:
    about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
    elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
    meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
    Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and Ross Island on McMurdo Sound;
    glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating
    ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent
Natural resources:
    none presently exploited; iron, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum,
    and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small,
    uncommercial quantities
Land use:
    no arable land and no plant growth; ice 98%, barren rock 2%
Environment:
    mostly uninhabitable; katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
    the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; a
    circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
    storms that form over the ocean; during summer more solar radiation reaches
    the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
    equivalent period; in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
    which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
    dwindled to its lowest level ever over Antarctica; active volcanism on
    Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic
    activity rare and weak

:Antigua and Barbuda Economy

Overview:
    The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
    determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real GDP
    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct
    contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -
    particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
    labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1991 by a
    downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $418 million, per capita $6,500 (1989); real
    growth rate 4.2% (1990 est.)

:Argentina Economy

Overview:
    Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
    an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
    Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
    economy has encountered major problems in recent years, leading to
    escalating inflation and a recession during 1988-90. Since 1978, Argentina's
    external debt has nearly doubled to $58 billion, creating severe debt
    servicing difficulties and hurting the country's creditworthiness with
    international lenders. Elected in 1989, President Menem has implemented a
    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
    Argentina's economic decline and putting it on a path of stable, sustainable
    growth.

:Armenia Economy

Overview:
    Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,
    machine-building, and other industries and had become a key supplier to
    sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
    and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
    republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has
    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
    Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave
    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
    warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured
    Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
    about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
    USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
    earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of
    Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of
    the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of
    nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are
    largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem
    particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
    dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
    transformation.

    refining and storage are also important. Hotel capacity expanded rapidly
    between 1985 and 1989 and nearly doubled in 1990 alone. Unemployment has
    steadily declined from about 20% in 1986 to about 3% in 1991. The reopening
    of the local oil refinery, once a major source of employment and foreign
    exchange earnings, promises to give the economy an additional boost.

    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
    primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.

:Austria Economy

Overview:
    Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
    proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits. Thanks
    to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor force,
    and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies specialized
    niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces
    almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in
    agriculture. Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and
    the opening of Eastern Europe, boosted the economy during 1990 and to a
    lesser extent in 1991. GDP growth slowed from 4.9% in 1990 to 3% in 1991 -
    mainly due to the weaker world economy - and is expected to drop to around
    2% in 1992. Inflation is forecasted at about 4%, while unemployment probably
    will increase moderately through 1992 before declining in 1993. Living
    standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
    Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level
    of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget
    capabilities. Austria, which has applied for EC membership, was involved in
    EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic
    Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of
    goods, services, capital, and labor within the EC.

:Azerbaijan Economy

Overview:
    Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
    the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
    its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
    standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,
    and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
    for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
    the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
    marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim
    Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
    accounts for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet
    Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
    civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic
    arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, Azerbaijan's
    economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 1991
    largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.

:The Bahamas Economy

Overview:
    The Bahamas is a stable, middle-income developing nation whose economy is

    40% of the local work force. The economy has slackened in recent years, as
    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per
    capita GDP of $9,900 is one of the highest in the region.

:Bangladesh Economy

Overview:
    Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world. The economy is based
    on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,
    which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.
    Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population
    growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited
    infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.
    Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually
    during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth
    rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.
    Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's
    development strategy.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $23.1 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate
    3.2% (FY91)

:Barbados Economy

Overview:
    A per capita income of $6,500 gives Barbados one of the highest standards of
    living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean.
    Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and
    related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified
    into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer
    of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy
    slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency
    reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an
    austere economic reform program.
GDP:

:Belarus Economy

Overview:
    In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states, for example, in its
    industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of living, and its
    critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
    materials. Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet
    republics, producing 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor
    force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies important producer
    and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to the other states.
    The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by
    emphasizing favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens),
    Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,
    eggs, flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and
    gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil
    pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit
    Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals,
    plastics, synthetic fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and
    fertilizer (20% of former Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited
    to potash and peat deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for
    the former Soviet Union) is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for
    electric power stations and in the production of chemicals. The potash
    supports fertilizer production.

:Benin Economy

Overview:
    Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
    limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. Agriculture
    accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor force, and
    generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
    contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Low
    prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benin's
    major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.
GDP:

:Bhutan Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture and
    forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population and
    account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
    the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The
    economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
    monetary links. Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in
    agriculture. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on
    Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for
    tourists are its most important natural resources.

:Bolivia Economy

Overview:
    The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between 1980 and 1985 as La Paz
    financed growing budget deficits by expanding the money supply, and
    inflation spiraled - peaking at 11,700%. An austere orthodox economic
    program adopted by then President Paz Estenssoro in 1985, however, succeeded
    in reducing inflation to between 10% and 20% annually since 1987, eventually
    restarting economic growth. Since August 1989, President Paz Zamora has
    retained the economic policies of the previous government, keeping inflation
    down and continuing moderate growth. Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be
    one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with widespread poverty and
    unemployment, and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for its
    limited exports - agricultural products, minerals, and natural gas.
    Moreover, for many farmers, who constitute half of the country's work force,
    the main cash crop is coca, which is sold for cocaine processing.

    47,900 hectares under cultivation; voluntary and forced eradication program
    unable to prevent production from rising to 78,400 metric tons in 1991 from
    74,700 tons in 1989; government considers all but 12,000 hectares illicit;
    intermediate coca products and cocaine exported to or through Colombia and
    Brazil to the US and other international drug markets

:Bosnia and Herzegovina Economy

Overview:
    Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest component in
    the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
    private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
    traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
    overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning
    and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
    the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
    Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1992, the newly independent
    republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
    production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery
    to multiply. The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit
    is in doubt. Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades
    and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups.
    These areas contain most of the industry. If a much smaller core Muslim
    state survives, it will share many Third World problems of poverty,
    technological backwardness, and dependence on historically soft foreign
    markets for its primary products. In these circumstances, other Muslim
    countries might offer assistance.

:Botswana Economy

Overview:
    The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
    Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population,
    but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving force behind the
    rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.
    This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating
    25% of GDP in 1980 to over 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such
    growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
    poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond
    production remained level in FY91, substantial gains in coal output and
    manufacturing helped boost the economy
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $3.6 billion, per capita $2,800; real growth
    rate 6.3% (1991 est.)

:Brazil Economy

Overview:
    The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
    the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
    foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition,
    the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by
    substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
    mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several
    multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
    private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
    violence. The Collor government, which assumed office in March 1990, is
    embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and
    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
    and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government in December
    1991 signed a letter of intent with the IMF for a 20-month standby loan.
    Having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated
    during 1989 and 1990, Brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged
    in talks on the reduction of medium- and long-term debt and debt service
    payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears. A major
    long-run strength is Brazil's vast natural resources.

:British Virgin Islands Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
    dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of the national
    income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies
    wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation
    fees generated about $2 million in 1987. Livestock raising is the most
    significant agricultural activity. The islands' crops, limited by poor
    soils, are unable to meet food requirements.

:Bulgaria Economy

Overview:
    Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the 2% annual level in
    the 1980s. By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 billion
    - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency earnings and
    leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.
    The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
    industrial plant; coping with worsening energy, food, and consumer goods
    shortages; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments;
    investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric power from
    nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and motivating workers, in
    part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises. Bulgaria's
    new government, led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov, is strongly committed
    to economic reform. The previous government, even though dominated by former
    Communists, had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
    planning system, bringing the economy back into balance, and reducing
    inflationary pressures. The program produced some encouraging early results,
    including eased restrictions on foreign investment, increased support from
    international financial institutions, and liberalized currency trading.
    Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small
    enterprises has taken place. The government has passed bills to privatize
    large state-owned enterprises and reform the banking system. Negotiations on
    an association agreement with the EC began in late 1991.

:Burma Economy

Overview:
    Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about $500. The
    nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
    earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.
    For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices
    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In
    1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
    position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which
    generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work
    force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
    and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little
    success.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $22.2 billion, per capita $530; real growth rate
    5.6% (1991)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

:Burundi Economy

Overview:
    A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
    development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts
    for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform
    agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September 1991.

:Cambodia Economy

Overview:
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting. The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The food
    situation remains precarious; during the 1980s famine was averted only
    through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the
    staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of domestic needs. The biggest
    success of the nation's recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing. Industry, other than rice processing, is almost nonexistent.
    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam, and both
    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
    USSR. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable.
    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped.

:Cameroon Economy

Overview:
    Because of its offshore oil resources, Cameroon has one of the highest
    incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
    problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political
    instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate
    for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid
    economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
    precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,
    cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and
    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support
    from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms
    designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,
    and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by
    opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.

:Canada Economy

Overview:
    As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
    the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern of
    production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
    mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
    economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
    registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
    averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
    and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
    the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking
    areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation;
    foreign investors are becoming edgy.

:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65% of GDP during
    the period 1985-88. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
    areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts
    for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the
    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

:Central African Republic Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
    economy, with more than 70% of the population living in the countryside. In

    products accounted for about 60% of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30%. The country's 1991 budget deficit was US $70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development

:Chad Economy

Overview:
    The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
    resources potential make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
    the world. Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict
    with Libya, drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its
    1977 level, with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports.
    Over 80% of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.
    Industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural
    products, including cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent
    on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from
    shortages. Oil companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the
    Doba basin in the south. Since coming to power in December 1990, the Deby
    government has experienced a year of economic chaos.

:Chile Economy

Overview:
    The government of President Aylwin, which took power in 1990, has opted to
    retain the orthodox economic policies of Pinochet, although the share of
    spending for social welfare has risen slightly. In 1991 growth in GDP
    recovered to 5.5% (led by consumer spending) after only 2.1% growth in 1990.
    The tight monetary policy of 1990 helped cut the rate of inflation from
    27.3% in 1990 to 18.7% in 1991. Despite a 12% drop in copper prices, the
    trade surplus rose in 1991, and international reserves increased.

    growth is likely to approach 7%.

:China Economy

Overview:
    Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the
    economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
    productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within the
    framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities have
    switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of
    the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and
    plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale
    enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign
    economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying
    result has been a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in
    the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal
    areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and
    modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
    export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the
    darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
    worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of
    capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has
    periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and
    thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process. In 1991 output rose
    substantially, particularly in the favored coastal areas. Popular
    resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres
    have weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the
    nation's long-term economic viability.

:Colombia Economy

Overview:
    Economic development has slowed gradually since 1986, but growth rates
    remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative economic policies have
    kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid
    development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries over the past
    four years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices - Colombia's
    major export. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the
    summer of 1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, and drug-related violence
    have dampened growth, but significant economic reforms are likely to
    facilitate a resurgent economy in the medium term. These reforms center on
    fiscal restraint, trade liberalization, and privatization of state utilities
    and commercial banks.

:Comoros Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several islands
    that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
    population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the
    labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high
    unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
    assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
    leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 34% to GDP, employs 80%
    of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not
    self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for
    90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an
    annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in
    1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for
    about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of
    1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and
    balance-of-payments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for 1991 show a
    moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,
    and government investment outlays.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $260 million, per capita $540; real growth rate
    2.7% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    4.0% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    over 16% (1988 est.)

Agriculture:
    accounts for 34% of GDP; most of population works in subsistence agriculture
    and fishing; plantations produce cash crops for export - vanilla, cloves,
    perfume essences, and copra; principal food crops - coconuts, bananas,
    cassava; world's leading producer of essence of ylang-ylang (for perfumes)
    and second-largest producer of vanilla; large net food importer

:Congo Economy

Overview:
    Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, a
    beginning industrial sector based largely on oil, supporting services, and a
    government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
    program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
    1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
    a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
    of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
    exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
    finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,
    one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,
    growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the
    population growth rate.

:Cook Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
    copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
    fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
    of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
    Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
    and expanding the fishing industry.

:Costa Rica Economy

Overview:
    In 1991 the economy grew at an estimated 2.5%, down somewhat from the 3.6%
    gain of 1990 and below the strong 5.5% gain of 1989. Increases in
    agricultural production (on the strength of good coffee and banana crops)
    and in construction have been offset by lower rates of growth for industry.
    In 1991 consumer prices rose by 27%, about the same as in 1990. The trade
    deficit of $270 million was substantially below the 1990 deficit of $677
    million. Unemployment is officially reported at 4.6%, but much
    underemployment remains. External debt, on a per capita basis, is among the

:Croatia Economy

Overview:
    Before the political disintegration of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia
    stood next to Slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area, with
    a per capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
    one-third above the Yugoslav average. Serbia and the Serb-dominated army of
    the old Yugoslavia, however, have seized Croatian territory, and the
    overriding determinant of Croatia's long-term economic prospects will be the
    final border settlement. Under the most favorable circumstances, Croatia
    will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and
    Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land. Even so, Croatia
    would face monumental problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
    Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage during
    the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and houses; and
    the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav
    republics. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially
    in the tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to salvage a
    desperate economic situation. However, peace and political stability must
    come first.

:Cuba Economy

Overview:
    The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned, is highly dependent
    on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar provided about
    two-thirds of export revenues in 1991, and over half was exported to the
    former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished
    farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied
    goods and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 5% largely as a result
    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
    the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
    China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
    government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
    and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet
    Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and nickel.
    The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from $4 billion in 1990 to about $1
    billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp
    decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have
    indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in 1992. Instead
    of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices
    in convertible currencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of
    fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, aggregate output dropped
    by one-fifth in 1991.

:Cyprus Economy

Overview:
    The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
    contributes 24% to GDP and employs 35% of the labor force, while the service
    sector contributes 44% to GDP and employs 45% of the labor force. Rapid
    growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
    have played important roles in the average 6.4% rise in GDP between 1985 and
    1990. In mid-1991, the World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of
    developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the
    Turkish Cypriot economy has less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a
    series of reverses in 1991. Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the
    collapse of the fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a
    drought, the Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant
    from Turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. Turkey normally
    underwrites a substantial portion of the TRNC economy.

:Czechoslovakia Economy

Overview:
    Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized by East European standards and has a
    well-educated and skilled labor force. GDP per capita has been the highest
    in Eastern Europe. Annual GDP growth slowed to less than 1 percent during
    the 1985-90 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw
    materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
    standards. In January 1991, Prague launched a sweeping program to convert
    its almost entirely state-owned and controlled economy to a market system.
    The koruna now enjoys almost full internal convertibility and over 90% of
    prices are set by the market. The government is planning to privatize all
    small businesses and roughly two-thirds of large enterprises by the end of
    1993. New private-sector activity is also expanding. Agriculture - 95%
    socialized - is to be privatized by the end of 1992. Reform has taken its
    toll on the economy: inflation was roughly 50% in 1991, unemployment was
    nearly 70%, and GDP dropped an estimated 15%. In 1992 the government is
    anticipating inflation of 10-15%, unemployment of 11-12%, and a drop in GDP
    of up to 8%. As of mid-1992, the nation appears to be splitting in two -
    into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.

:Denmark Economy

Overview:
    This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale
    and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
    living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark probably
    will continue its successful economic recovery in 1992 with tight fiscal and
    monetary policies and export- oriented growth. Prime Minister Schluter's
    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze public-sector
    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit. The rate of growth by
    1993 - boosted by increased investment and domestic demand - may be
    sufficient to start to cut Denmark's high unemployment rate, which is
    expected to remain at about 11% in 1992. Low inflation, low wage increases,
    and the current account surplus put Denmark in a good competitive position
    for the EC's anticipated single market, although Denmark must cut its VAT
    and income taxes.

:Djibouti Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
    Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
    international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
    resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
    major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last
    five years because of recession and a high population growth rate (including
    immigrants and refugees).
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $340 million, $1,000 per capita; real growth rate
    -1.0% (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.7% (1989)
Unemployment rate:
    over 30% (1989)
Budget:
    revenues $131 million; expenditures $154 million, including capital
    expenditures of $25 million (1990 est.)
Exports:
    $190 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    hides and skins, coffee (in transit)
  partners:
    Middle East 50%, Africa 43%, Western Europe 7%
Imports:
    $311 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals, petroleum products
  partners:
    EC 36%, Africa 21%, Asia 12%, US 2%
External debt:
    $355 million (December 1990)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 0.1% (1989); manufacturing accounts for 4% of GDP
Electricity:
    115,000 kW capacity; 200 million kWh produced, 580 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as dairy products and
    mineral-water bottling
Agriculture:
    accounts for only 5% of GDP; scanty rainfall limits crop production to
    mostly fruit and vegetables; half of population pastoral nomads herding
    goats, sheep, and camels; imports bulk of food needs
Economic aid:
    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY78-89), $39 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, including ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $1.1

:Dominican Republic Economy

Overview:
    The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported components average 60%
    of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of free
    trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for
    export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also
    increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
    source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
    principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,
    and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
    products, durable consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is
    officially reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment.
    A fiscal austerity program has brought inflation under control, but in 1991
    the economy contracted for a second straight year.

:Ecuador Economy

Overview:
    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth
    has been uneven because of natural disasters (for example, a major
    earthquake in 1987), fluctuations in global oil prices, and government
    policies designed to curb inflation. The government has not taken a
    supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment, although
    its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone is an encouraging move. As
    1991 ended, Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will
    permit the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt.

:Egypt Economy

Overview:
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
    Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
    in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balance-of-payments support. As part of the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation, promote
    economic growth, and improve its external position. The reforms have been
    slow in coming, however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months to
    Egypt's population exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the total land area
    available for agriculture.

:El Salvador Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for 25% of GDP, employs about 40% of the
    labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports. Coffee is the major
    commercial crop, accounting for 45% of export earnings. The manufacturing
    sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 18% of
    GDP and 15% of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla sabotage
    total more than $2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large

:Equatorial Guinea Economy

Overview:
    The economy, destroyed during the regime of former President Macias NGUEMA,
    is now based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for about
    half of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates,
    with cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange,
    and government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for
    about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for
    about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
    manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under
    concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately
    successful.

:Estonia Economy

Overview:
    Starting in July 1991, under a new law on private ownership, small
    enterprises, such as retail shops and restaurants, were sold to private
    owners. The auctioning of large-scale enterprises is now in progress with
    the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership (that is,
    Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States) can be established.
    Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former Soviet
    republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production, and
    provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is in
    agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both
    capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products
    from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of high
    quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.
    Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%
    of old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million tons). Estonia has a
    large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
    needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. Like the other 14
    successor republics, Estonia is suffering through a difficult transitional
    period - between a collapsed command economic structure and a
    still-to-be-built market structure. It has advantages in the transition, not
    having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having better chances of
    developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries.

:Ethiopia Economy

Overview:
    Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Africa. Its
    economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of
    GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of
    export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
    from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less
    than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering selling
    off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural weather largely
    explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas drought and
    deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY90. In 1991
    the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, interfered with
    economic development and growth.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $6.6 billion, per capita $130, real growth rate-
    0.4% (FY90 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

Industries:
    food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals, metals processing, cement
Agriculture:
    accounts for 45% of GDP and is the most important sector of the economy even
    though frequent droughts and poor cultivation practices keep farm output
    low; famines not uncommon; export crops of coffee and oilseeds grown partly
    on state farms; estimated 50% of agricultural production at subsistence
    level; principal crops and livestock - cereals, pulses, coffee, oilseeds,
    sugarcane, potatoes and other vegetables, hides and skins, cattle, sheep,
    goats

:Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
    most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
    consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
    for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to
    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
    1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
    amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income
    for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
    wildlife and trout fishing.

:Faroe Islands Economy

Overview:
    The Faroese, who have long been enjoying the affluent living standards of
    the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
    all-important fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
    annual income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
    200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue
    their traditional long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
    nearby fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its
    austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force
    further reductions in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued
    with bankrupcies. An annual Danish subsidy of $140 million continues to
    provide roughly one-third of the islands' budget revenues.

:Fiji Economy

Overview:
    Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector.
    Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and sugar processing
    accounts for one-third of industrial output. Industry, including sugar
    milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
    sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In
    1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP
    dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty
    created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
    production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
    performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the
    economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an
    estimated 21%.

    capita output nearly three-fourths the US figure. Its main economic force is
    the manufacturing sector - principally the wood, metals, and engineering
    industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about
    30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on
    imported raw materials, energy, and some components of manufactured goods.
    Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
    self-sufficiency in basic commodities. The economy, which experienced an
    average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into a deep
    recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.2%. The recession - which is
    expected to bottom out in late 1992 - has been caused by economic
    overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter
    system between Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and
    gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
    Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
    efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public
    expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and foreign
    investment and exchange liberalization. Helsinki tied the markkaa to the
    EC's European Currency Unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue
    the markkaa by about 12% in November 1991. The devaluation should improve
    industrial competitiveness and business confidence in 1992. Finland, as a
    member of EFTA, negotiated a European Economic Area arrangement with the EC
    that allows for free movement of capital, goods, services, and labor within
    the organization as of January 1993. Finland applied for full EC membership
    in March 1992.

:France Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
    agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
    Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and
    subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
    Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products
    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
    generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy. After expanding at a rapid 3.8% pace during
    the period 1988-89, the economy slowed down in 1990, with growth of 1.5% in
    1990 and 1.4% in 1991; growth in 1992 is expected to be about 2%. The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
    labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate, which rose to almost 10%
    in 1991. The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
    sectors.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $1,033.7 billion, per capita $18,300; real

    mining, textiles, food processing, and tourism
Agriculture:
    accounts for 4% of GDP (including fishing and forestry); one of the world's
    top five wheat producers; other principal products - beef, dairy products,
    cereals, sugar beets, potatoes, wine grapes; self-sufficient for most
    temperate-zone foods; shortages include fats and oils and tropical produce,
    but overall net exporter of farm products; fish catch of 850,000 metric tons
    ranks among world's top 20 countries and is all used domestically

:French Guiana Economy

Overview:
    The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.
    Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most
    important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products
    (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1987. The
    large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
    expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation
    of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - are limited to the
    coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is
    heavily dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious
    problem, particularly among younger workers.

:Gabon Economy

Overview:
    The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
    dominated by the oil sector. During the period 1981-85, oil accounted for
    about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on
    average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial
    increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced
    migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to
    among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of Gabon's
    economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989
    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows. In 1990 the
    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes, but debt servicing
    problems are hindering economic advancement. The agricultural and industrial
    sectors are relatively underdeveloped, except for oil.

    limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's poorest countries with a
    per capita income of about $230. About 75% of the population is engaged in
    crop production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP.
    Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides -
    accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia
    imports one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods.
    Exports are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post - Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors,
    and a peace treaty be-tween Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all
    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
    the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
    framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be
    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's
    special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the
    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
    rest of the West Bank.
    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and
    Israeli civil administration; it is US policy that the final status of the
    Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties;
    these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed.
    There are 18 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

:Gaza Strip Economy

Overview:
    In 1990 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
    Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
    remittances accounting for about one-third of GNP. The construction,
    agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of
    GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external
    trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-92 (intifadah) has raised
    unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
    Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
    since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,
    unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically. The area's
    economic outlook remains bleak.

    tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and the amazing
    diversity of an industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2%
    of the USSR's output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been
    a flourishing private sector (compared with the other republics). Almost 30%
    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18% in industry. Mineral
    resources consist of manganese and copper, and, to a lesser extent,
    molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. Except for very small quantities
    of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be imported from neighboring
    republics. Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
    the port of Batumi for export and local refining. Gas is supplied in
    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol'. Georgia is nearly self-sufficient
    in electric power, thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some
    thermal power stations. The dismantling of central economic controls is
    being delayed by political factionalism, marked by armed struggles between
    the elected government and the opposition, and industrial output seems to
    have fallen more steeply in Georgia in 1991 than in any other of the former
    Soviet republics. To prevent further economic decline, Georgia must
    establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
    Soviet republics while developing new links to the West.

:Germany Economy

Overview:
    The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in
    integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, but at a heavy economic cost.
    Western Germany's growth in 1991 slowed to 3.1% - the lowest rate since 1987
    - because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
    by the unification process. While western Germany's economy was in recession
    in the last half of 1991, eastern Germany's economy bottomed out after a
    nearly two-year freefall and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the
    construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1992 in construction,
    transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly different,
    however, despite eastern Germany's progress. Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant
    leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
    Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods. The region's economy is mature: services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent
    years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for
    about 21% of GDP. In 1991, GDP in the western region was an estimated
    $19,200 per capita. In contrast, eastern Germany's economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era. Eastern Germany's share of all-German GDP is only about 7%, and eastern
    productivity is just 30% that of the west. The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly selling many of the 11,500 firms
    under its control. The pace of private investment is starting to pick up,
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain.
    Eastern Germany has one of the world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain; the
    federal government began producing all-German data for select economic
    statistics at the start of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding
    the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western Germany's
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wage-price spiral. Meanwhile, the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe.

:Ghana Economy

Overview:
    Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
    implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
    moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
    dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
    spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
    peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
    democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and
    undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in
    1990. Much of the economic improvement in 1991 was caused by favorable
    weather (following a severe drought the previous year) that led to plentiful
    harvests in Ghana's agriculturally based economy.

:Greece Economy

Overview:
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office. Tourism continues as a major industry, and
    agriculture - although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented,
    small farms - is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
    feedstuffs. The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations, which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning current account
    deficit, and accelerating inflation. In early 1991, the government secured a
    $2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. Over the next three
    years, Athens must bring inflation down to 7%, cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP, slash
    public-sector employment by 10%, curb public-sector pay raises, and broaden
    the tax base.

:Greenland Economy

Overview:
    Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from one based on
    subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade.
    Fishing is still the most important industry, accounting for over 75% of
    exports and about 25% of the population's income. Maintenance of a social
    welfare system similar to Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant
    role in the economy. In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on
    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy (now about $500 million) from the
    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
    production stopped. As of 1992, the government also has taken control of the
    health sector from Denmark. The new Home Rule government installed in March
    1991 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
    open it wider to competitive forces.

:Guadeloupe Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
    It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
    a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
    large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
    sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
    (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers.
    Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
    although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly
    from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.
    Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
    high among the young.

:Guyana Economy

Overview:
    Guyana is one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita income less
    than one-fifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
    than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline
    resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and
    equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 100%
    in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
    substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power is
    in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
    output. The government, in association with international financial
    agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
    government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic
    exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -
    requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
    by consumers during a long incubation period. In 1991, buoyed by a recovery
    in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth, according to
    official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi- legal economic
    activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total output.

:Haiti Economy

Overview:
    About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
    small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of the work
    force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
    drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
    assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
    one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
    erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the
    Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup
    against President Aristide have further damaged the economy.

:Honduras Economy

Overview:
    Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
    Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
    than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of
    exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
    employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates
    20% of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
    account for 50% of GDP and employ nearly 20% of the labor force. Basic
    problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
    unemployment, sharply increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large
    and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export sector
    mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.

    economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural resources.

:Hong Kong Economy

Overview:
    Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
    barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the
    labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
    remarkable 8% in 1987-88, then slowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment,
    which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of
    labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.
    Short-term prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue
    to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 1989-91 casts a
    shadow over the longer term economic outlook.

:Hungary Economy

Overview:
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of
    GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 20% of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD
    members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.
    In 1990, Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in 1991 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
    accounts for one-quarter to one-third of national output according to
    unofficial estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing,
    although excessive redtape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform,
    while Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before 1993.

:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant. The conservative government's economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
    krona to the EC's European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries -
    notably the shrimp industry - are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20% in 1989 to about
    7.5% in 1991 and possibly 3% in 1992, while unemployment is expected to
    increase to 2.5%. GDP is expected to contract by nearly 4% in 1992.

:India Economy

Overview:
    India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts,
    modern agriculture, old and new branches of industry, and a multitude of
    support services. It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold. Growth of 4-5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the
    environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south,
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty, and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life. Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher inflation, and
    a large debt service burden.

:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets
    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An
    estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian
    Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
    actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
    Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
    based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
    minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
    placer deposits

:Indonesia Economy

Overview:
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
    increasing population, it remains a poor country. GDP growth in 1985-91
    averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
    labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
    sector, accounting for 23% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The
    staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is
    now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
    timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external
    economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and 40% of
    export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly dependent
    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan is Indonesia's most
    important customer and supplier of aid. In 1991, rapid growth in the money
    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy, forcing the
    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
    interest rates remained above 10%, off-shore commercial debt grew, and real
    GDP growth dropped slightly from the 7% of 1990.

    exchange rate conversion - $122 billion, per capita $630; real growth rate

:Iran Economy

Overview:
    Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
    other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
    trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Iran's GNP
    grew roughly 4% in FY90 and 10% in FY91. An oil windfall in 1990 combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Iran's recent economic
    growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention (including subsidies) and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991 - oil accounts for more
    than 90% of export revenues and provides roughly 65% of the financing for
    the five-year economic development plan - and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,
    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.

:Iraq Economy

Overview:
    The Ba`thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
    industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale
    industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The
    economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has provided about 95%
    of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s financial problems, caused by
    massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil
    export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity
    measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.
    After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
    the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.
    Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization,
    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
    programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the
    government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait
    in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
    changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero, and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged. Throughout
    1991, the UN's economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
    increase prices for most goods. The government's policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages.

:Ireland Economy

Overview:
    The economy is small, open, and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
    important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of GDP
    and about 80% of exports and employs 26% of the labor force. The government
    has successfully reduced the rate of inflation from double-digit figures in
    the late 1970s to 3.8% in 1991. In 1987, after years of deficits, the
    balance of payments was brought into the black. Unemployment, however,
    remains a serious problem. A 1991 unemployment rate of 20.4% placed Ireland
    along with Spain as the countries with the worst jobless records in Western
    Europe.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $39.2 billion, per capita $11,200; real growth
    rate 1.3% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.8% (1991)
Unemployment rate:
    20.4% (1991)
Budget:

    expenditures of $1.6 billion (1992 est.)
Exports:
    $27.8 billion (f.o.b., 1991)
  commodities:

Note:
    The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
    in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed
    by President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
    the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. The Camp David Accords further specify that these
    negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West Bank and Gaza
    Strip entries). On 25 April 1982 Israel relinquished control of the Sinai to
    Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are included in the
    Syria entry.

:Israel Economy

Overview:
    Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation. It
    depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
    equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
    developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
    Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services
    most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
    products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts
    balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments
    from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17
    billion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major
    source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel
    has been targeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as
    medical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 dealt a
    blow to Israel's economy. Higher world oil prices added an estimated $300
    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
    18%. Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising (intifadah)
    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism - a key foreign exchange earner
    - to the lowest level since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The influx of Jewish
    immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 330,000 during the period
    1990-91, will increase unemployment, intensify housing problems, widen the
    government budget deficit, and fuel inflation.

:Italy Economy

Overview:
    Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
    into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same total and per
    capita output as France and the UK. The country is still divided into a
    developed industrial north, dominated by small private companies, and an
    undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.
    Services account for 48% of GDP, industry about 35%, agriculture 4%, and
    public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
    75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual
    average rate of 3% during the period 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in
    1991. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community.

:Ivory Coast Economy

Overview:
    Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers and exporters of coffee,
    cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is highly
    sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and
    to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to diversify, the
    economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries.
    The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of
    export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A collapse of
    world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession,
    from which the country had not recovered by 1990. Continuing poor prices for
    commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated public-sector wage
    bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery in 1991.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $10 billion, per capita $800; real growth rate
    -2.9% (1990)

    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
    industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic
    recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the
    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The
    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
    sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
    crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the
    economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was
    largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
    however, growth dropped to 1.0% as a result of the US recession, lower world
    bauxite prices, and monetary instability.

:Japan Economy

Overview:
    Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
    small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
    rapidity, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important
    sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
    fuels. Self-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements for
    other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest
    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. Overall
    economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%
    average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overall growth of
    4.5% in 1991 was net exports, which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
    domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3% and is easing due to lower
    oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,
    $80 billion in 1991, which supports extensive investment in foreign assets.
    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
    population are two major long-run problems.

:Jersey Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
    tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
    important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
    cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
    products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
    overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the
    island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
    industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
    has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
    material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
    Jersey's food needs.

:Jordan Economy

Overview:
    Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late
    1970s and early 1980s, when its annual GNP growth averaged more than 10%. In
    the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker
    remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year.
    Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - have been
    outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and
    borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling
    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually
    reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
    Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordan's
    already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
    program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid
    from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged, and refugees have
    flooded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is
    unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.

:Kazakhstan Economy

Overview:
    The second-largest in area of the 15 former Soviet republics, Kazakhstan has
    vast oil, coal, and agricultural resources. Kazakhstan is highly dependent
    on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
    and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
    problems, backward technology, and little experience in foreign markets. The
    government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
    Russia's program. The ongoing transitional period - marked by sharp
    inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and disruption of
    time-honored channels of supply - has brought considerable social unrest.
    Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skills for a quick
    recovery of output. US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
    face formidable obstacles; for example, oil can now reach Western markets
    only through pipelines that run across independent (and sometimes
    unfriendly) former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic
    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million
    Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility
    of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologically
    advancing society.

:Kenya Economy

Overview:
    Kenya's 3.6% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the world
    - presents a serious problem for the country's economy. In the meantime, GDP
    growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - annually
    averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
    shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
    economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and
    sagging export prices held economic growth below the all-important
    population growth figure.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $9.7 billion, per capita $385 (1989 est.); real
    growth rate 2.3% (1991 est.)

:Kiribati Economy

Overview:
    The country has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
    deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish
    now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated
    widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish
    catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production
    was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real
    GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in
    copra production and a good fish catch. Following the strong surge in output
    in 1988, GNP increased 1% in both 1989 and 1990.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $36.8 million, per capita $525; real growth rate
    1.0% (1990 est.)

  commodities:
    fish 55%, copra 42%
  partners:
    EC 20%, Marshall Islands 12%, US 8%, American Samoa 4% (1985)
Imports:
    $26.7 million (c.i.f., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    foodstuffs, fuel, transportation equipment
  partners:
    Australia 39%, Japan 21%, NZ 6%, UK 6%, US 3% (1985)
External debt:

:Korea, North Economy

Overview:
    More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land is
    collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
    strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during
    the period 1984-89 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 2-4% annually
    during 1990-91, largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR. Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
    industrial development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal,
    iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.
    Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, with light industry lagging far
    behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
    and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
    self-sufficient in food production. Four consecutive years of poor harvests,
    coupled with distribution problems, have led to chronic food shortages.
    North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development and
    living standards.

:Korea, South Economy

    development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial
    society. Real GNP has increased more than 10% annually over the past six
    years. This growth has led to an overheated situation characterized by a
    tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising
    current account deficit. Policymakers have stated they will focus attention

:Kuwait Economy

Overview:
    Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990, the oil sector had dominated the
    economy. Kuwait has the third-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
    Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90% of both
    export and government revenues and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the
    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government
    revenues. Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war
    has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80% of
    Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaged key surface
    facilities. Firefighters brought all of the roughly 750 oil well fires and
    blowouts under control by November 1991. By yearend, production had been
    brought back to 400,000 barrels per day; it could take two to three years to
    restore Kuwait's oil production to its prewar level of about 2.0 million
    barrels per day. Meanwhile, population had been greatly reduced because of
    the war, from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.

:Kyrgyzstan Economy

Overview:
    Kyrgyzstan's small economy (less than 1% of the total for the former Soviet
    Union) is oriented toward agriculture, producing mainly livestock such as
    goats and sheep, as well as cotton, grain, and tobacco. Industry,
    concentrated around Bishkek, produces small quantities of electric motors,
    livestock feeding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, paper, and
    bricks. Mineral extraction is small, the most important minerals being rare
    earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of most types of food
    and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. By early 1991, the Kirghiz
    leadership had accelerated reform, primarily by privatizing business and
    granting life-long tenure to farmers. In 1991 overall industrial and
    livestock output declined substantially.

    enterprises of any size. In recent years, however, the government has been
    decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a
    landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no
    railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal
    telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.
    Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of
    GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is
    rice. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
    survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid
    from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.

:Latvia Economy

Overview:
    Latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned economy
    inherited from the former USSR into a market economy. Prices have been
    freed, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks natural
    resources, aside from its arable land and small forests. Its most valuable
    economic asset is its work force, which is better educated and disciplined
    than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial production is highly
    diversified, with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer
    electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia produces only 10% of its
    electric power needs. Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial
    ties to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward
    joint ventures, technological support, and trade ties to the West. Because
    of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms, Latvians enjoy a diet that
    is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and lower in grain and
    potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the USSR. Good
    relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic Russians
    (34% of the population) and native Latvians.

:Lebanon Government

Note:
    Between early 1975 and late 1976 Lebanon was torn by civil war between its
    Christians - then aided by Syrian troops - and its Muslims and their
    Palestinian allies. The cease-fire established in October 1976 between the
    domestic political groups generally held for about six years, despite
    occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab Deterrent Force
    by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's move toward supporting
    the Lebanese Muslims, and the Palestinians and Israel's growing support for
    Lebanese Christians, brought the two sides into rough equilibrium, but no
    progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms - the
    original cause of the war. Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian
    presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982.
    Israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and
    mounted a summer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of
    the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
    force (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian troops. Within days of the
    departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected president, Bashir Gemayel, was
    assassinated; his elder brother Amin was elected to succeed him. In the
    immediate wake of Bashir's death, however, Christian militiamen massacred
    hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps. This prompted the
    return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanon's weak Army and
    security forces. In late March 1984 the last MNF units withdrew. In 1988,
    President Gemayel completed his term of office. Because parliamentarians
    failed to elect a presidential successor, Gemayel appointed then Lebanese
    Armed Forces (LAF) Commander Gen. Michel Awn acting president. Lebanese
    parliamentarians met in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, in late 1989 and concluded a
    national reconciliation pact that codified a new power-sharing formula,
    specifying reduced powers for the Christian president and giving Muslims
    more authority. Rene MUAWAD was subsequently elected president on 4 November
    1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no president and
    rival Muslim and Christian governments. MUAWAD was assassinated 17 days
    later, on 22 November; on 24 November, Ilyas Harawi was elected to succeed
    MUAWAD. In October 1990, the civil war was apparently brought to a
    conclusion when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General
    Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut. Awn had defied the legitimate
    government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after
    being appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988.
    Awn and his supporters feared Ta'if would diminish Christian power in
    Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria. Awn was granted amnesty and
    allowed to travel in France in August 199l. Since the removal of Awn, the
    Lebanese Government has made substantial progress in strengthening the
    central government, rebuilding government institutions, and extending its
    authority throughout the nation. The LAF has deployed from Beirut north
    along the coast road to Tripoli, southeast into the Shuf mountains, and
    south to Sidon and Tyre. Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups
    have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north, south, and east of
    the country. Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned
    over to the government, or sold outside the country, which has begun a plan
    to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security
    forces. Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in
    May 1991. Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops, which
    are deployed in Beirut, its southern suburbs, the Bekaa Valley, and northern
    Lebanon. Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards in
    the Bekaa Valley to support Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups. Israel
    withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985, although it still
    retains troops in a 10-km-deep security zone north of its border with
    Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), which also
    occupies the security zone and is Israel's first line of defense against
    attacks on its northern border. The following description is based on the
    present constitutional and customary practices of the Lebanese system.

    infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's
    position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Following October
    1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
    restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port
    and government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up by
    a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale
    manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and
    farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main
    sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991,
    industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial
    gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country could provide a
    major stimulus to the economy in 1992, provided that the political and
    military situation remains reasonably calm.

:Lesotho Economy

Overview:
    Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
    resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
    manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($153
    million in 1989). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods
    from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
    farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;
    other industries include textile, clothing, and light engineering.
    Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and
    economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for Lesotho's
    economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances - typically
    about 40% of GDP.

:Liberia Economy

Overview:
    Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the
    infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate businessmen fled the
    country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return.
    Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate
    favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
    products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in
    scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
    and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring
    countries. In 1991, the political impasse between the interim government and
    the rebel leader Charles Taylor prevented restoration of normal economic
    life.

:Libya Economy

Overview:
    The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
    sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about
    one-third of GDP. Since 1980, however, the sharp drop in oil prices and the
    resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected economic
    development. In 1988 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at $5,410, but
    GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in
    the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient resource
    allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs, although
    the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the
    Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages.
    Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the
    government's ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure
    development projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in
    late 1990 improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current
    account surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing
    and construction sectors, which account for about 22% of GDP, have expanded
    from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals,
    iron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for about 5% of
    GDP, it employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor
    soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
    requirements.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $28.9 billion, per capita $6,800; real growth
    rate 9% (1990 est.)

:Liechtenstein Economy

Overview:
    The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light industry and
    tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the service sector
    45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. The sale of
    postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million annually. Low
    business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules
    have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to
    establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated
    solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied
    closely to that of Switzerland in a customs union, and incomes and living
    standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.

:Lithuania Economy

Overview:
    Lithuania is striving to become a small, independent, largely privatized
    economy rather than a segment of a huge, centrally planned economy. Although
    substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old
    USSR, Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in economic
    development. It is ahead of its Baltic neighbors, however, in implementing
    market reform. The country has no important natural resources aside from its
    arable land and strategic location. Industry depends entirely on imported
    materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR. Lithuania
    benefits from its ice-free port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail
    and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land communication between
    Eastern Europe and Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry produces a
    small assortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex machine
    tools to sophisticated consumer electronics. Thanks to nuclear power,
    Lithuania is presently self-sufficient in electricity, exporting its surplus
    to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR,
    however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety
    standards. Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet
    Union. Lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat, second
    place for eggs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy products.
    Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries. As to
    economic reforms, Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at
    least 60% of state-owned property (industry, agriculture, and housing)
    having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system. Other
    government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting
    the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from
    Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets. For the moment,
    Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy, raw materials,
    grains, and markets for its products.

:Luxembourg Economy

Overview:
    The stable economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and negligible
    unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly productive
    family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently dominated by
    steel, has become increasingly more diversified, particularly toward
    high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth in the financial
    sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services,
    especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the economy.

    financial matters and is also closely connected economically to the
    Netherlands.

:Macedonia Economy

Overview:
    Macedonia, although the poorest among the six republics of a disintegrated
    Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
    agricultural and coal resources. As a breakaway republic, however, it will
    move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are
    reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia, Albania, Greece, and
    Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas
    and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both
    internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of
    trade patterns and economic rules of the game. Inflation in early 1992 was
    out of control, the result of fracturing trade links, the decline in
    economic activity, and general uncertainties about the future status of the
    country; prices rose 38% in March 1992 alone. Macedonia's geographical
    isolation, technological backwardness, and political instability place it
    far down the list of countries of interest to Western investors. Recognition
    of Macedonia by the EC and an internal commitment to economic reform would
    help to encourage foreign investment over the long run.
GDP:

    tobacco
Agriculture:

:Madagascar Economy

Overview:
    Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
    including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting
    for over 40% of GDP, employing about 80% of the labor force, and
    contributing to more than 70% of total export earnings. Industry is largely
    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
    manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for only 16% of GDP and employed almost
    5% of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year
    development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by
    1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After
    mid-1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted
    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.

:Malawi Economy

Overview:
    Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed countries. The
    economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the population
    living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of export
    revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth improved
    significantly in 1988-91 as a result of good weather and a broadly based

:Malaysia Economy

Overview:
    During the period 1988-91 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to
    recover from the severe 1985-86 recession. Real output grew by 8.8% in 1989,
    10% in 1990, and 8.6% in 1991, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing
    output, further increases in foreign direct investment - particularly from
    Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home - and increased oil
    production. Malaysia has become the world's third-largest producer of
    semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan) and the world's largest
    exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low; unemployment
    has stood at 6% of the labor force; and the government has followed prudent
    fiscal/monetary policies. The country is not self-sufficient in food, and
    some of the rural population subsist at the poverty level. Malaysia's high
    export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries
    or a fall in world commodity prices.

:Maldives Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on fishing, tourism, and shipping. Agriculture is
    limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that provide only 10%
    of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the
    work force and accounting for over 60% of exports; it is also an important
    source of government revenue. During the 1980s tourism has become one of the
    most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1988 industry
    accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real GDP is officially estimated to have
    increased by about 10% annually during the period 1974-90.

:Man, Isle of Economy

Overview:
    Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy.
    The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology companies
    and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
    employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
    and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
    shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing
    about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK.

:Marshall Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
    production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial
    crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches
    supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry is limited to
    handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary
    source of foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The
    islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987
    the US Government provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese
    budget of $55 million.

:Martinique Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry.
    Agriculture accounts for about 12% of GDP and the small industrial sector
    for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used
    for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to
    France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be
    imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
    transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1986
    per capita GDP was relatively high at $6,000. During 1986 the unemployment
    rate was 30% and was particularly severe among younger workers.

:Mauritania Economy

Overview:
    A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for
    a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
    were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
    Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50%
    of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led
    to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
    fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
    this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
    Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with
    Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
    substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second
    stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the
    IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process suffered a major
    setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of Mauritania's
    support of Saddam Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi
    Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.

:Mexico Economy

Overview:
    Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial plants (notably
    oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
    traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
    prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;
    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988
    to 4% in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexico's major trading partner,
    accounting for two-thirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
    a free trade agreement.

    isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to
    long-term growth.

:Moldova Economy

Overview:
    Moldova, the next-to-smallest of the former Soviet republics in area, is the
    most densely inhabited. Moldova has a little more than 1% of the population,
    labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living
    standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys
    a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on
    agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry
    accounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than
    one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
    former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic
    equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.
    Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the
    other former Soviet republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and
    has legalized private ownership of property, including agricultural land.
    Moldova's economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
    former Soviet republics and Romania.

:Mongolia Economy

Overview:
    Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
    tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors. In 1991-92 Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations, mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade and
    development partner. Moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1991, and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend 1991 makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for 1992. Industry in 1991-92 has been hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.
    The government is moving away from the Soviet-style centrally planned

:Morocco Economy

Overview:
    The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in worker
    remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by 4.2%, although nonagricultural output grew by less than
    1%. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of domestic demand,
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached a new
    12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the IMF. In February
    1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's commercial debt.
    This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993 the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
    unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe long-term problems.

:Mozambique Economy

Overview:
    One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
    transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
    internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
    foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic
    reform policy, has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
    1985. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75% of its 1981
    level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of
    capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat.
    The continuation of civil strife through 1991 has dimmed chances of foreign
    investment, and growth was a mere 1%. Living standards, already abysmally
    low, dropped by 3-4% in both 1990 and 1991.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $1.7 billion, per capita $120; real growth rate
    1.0% (1991 est.)

  commodities:
    shrimp 48%, cashews 21%, sugar 10%, copra 3%, citrus 3%

    fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the
    richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
    diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
    and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal. More than half the
    population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its
    livelihood.

:Nauru Economy

Overview:
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,000 annually.
    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition.

:Nepal Economy

Overview:
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
    Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
    90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is
    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,
    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has
    expanded recently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in
    FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
    natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
    in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population
    growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
    partly because of poor distribution. Since May 1991, the government has been
    encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies
    to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order
    to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects
    for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base.

:Netherlands Economy

Overview:
    This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise.
    The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
    permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of economic

    GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the
    food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly
    mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but
    provides large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing
    industry. An unemployment rate of 6.2% and a sizable budget deficit are
    currently the most serious economic problems.

:New Zealand Economy

Overview:
    Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
    on a guaranteed British market to an open free market economy that can
    compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
    would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
    expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is
    down from double-digit levels, but growth has been sluggish and
    unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% since May
    1991. In 1988, GDP fell by 1%, in 1989 grew by a moderate 2.4%, and was flat
    in 1990-91.

:Nicaragua Economy

Overview:
    Government control of the economy historically has been extensive, although
    the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention. Four
    private banks have been licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods. Over 50% of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities,
    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989 and 4%
    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs
    44% of the work force and accounts for 15% of GDP and 80% of export
    earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes
    about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and
    remained flat in 1991; output still is below pre-1979 levels. External debt
    is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis. In 1991 the
    inflation rate was 766%, down sharply from the 13,490% of 1990.

:Niger Economy

Overview:
    About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising,
    activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy also
    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium
    production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s
    when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,
    Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe
    trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.
GDP:

:Nigeria Economy

Overview:
    Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing country, it remains poor
    with a $250 per capita GDP. In 1991 massive government spending, much of it
    to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule, ballooned the budget
    deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. The lack of fiscal
    discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an
    18-month standby facility started in January 1991. Lagos has set ambitious
    targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign
    companies more attractive investment incentives. Government efforts to
    reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
    growth, however, have fallen short because of inadequate new investment
    funds and endemic corruption. Living standards continue to deteriorate from
    the higher level of the early 1980s oil boom.

:Niue Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
    expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants
    from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The
    agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some
    cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small
    factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The
    sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
    revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
    population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

:Norway Economy

Overview:
    Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity
    and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the
    vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state enterprises and
    extensively subsidizes agricultural, fishing, and other sectors. Norway also
    maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public-sector
    expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the
    highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
    dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw
    materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
    medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The
    country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower,
    fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
    keep its economy afloat. Although one of the government's main priorities is
    to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years
    to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget.
    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because
    of public-sector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
    and demand. Inflation will remain about 3%, while unemployment continues at
    record levels of over 5% because of the weakness of the economy outside the
    oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, is continuing to
    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
    Economic Area (EEA) - which creates a EC/EFTA market with free movement of
    capital, goods, services, and labor - which takes effect in 1993.

:Pacific Ocean Geography

Total area:
    165,384,000 km2
Land area:
    165,384,000 km2; includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering
    Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makassar
    Strait, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
    Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly less than 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed
    by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
    one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
    world
Coastline:
    135,663 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
    the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer
    months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a
    dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land
    mass back to the ocean
Terrain:
    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm-water gyre
    (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific by a
    counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
    in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
    Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches; the
    world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
    deposits, fish
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
    turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea;
    dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
    southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in
    southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
    October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
    Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
    September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
    occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
    winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing
    the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
    the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds
    to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
Note:
    the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
    and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
    North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
    superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
    south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
    to December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent
    volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
    of Fire

:Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap
    sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds,
    offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
    construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
    catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
    catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
    gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of

:Pakistan Economy

Overview:
    Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems of
    rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and heavy
    dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy must support a large
    military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million Afghan
    refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent years has
    enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost all agriculture and
    small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked on a
    sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic
    private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF government
    has denationalized several state-owned firms and has attracted some foreign
    investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards
    because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate of growth,
    population would double in 25 years.

:Panama Economy

Overview:
    GDP expanded by roughly 9.3% in 1991, following growth of 4.6% in 1990 and a
    0.4% contraction in 1989. Delay in coming to terms with the international
    financial institutions on policies to implement structural reform in Panama
    generated uncertainty in the private sector and tempered the pace of
    business expansion in 1991. Public investment was limited as the
    administration kept the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP. Unemployment and
    economic reform are the two major issues the government must face in
    1992-93.

:Papua New Guinea Economy

Overview:
    Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
    has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
    infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the
    population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
    for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and
    development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
    Robust growth in 1991 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large
    new gold mine featured in the advance.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $3.1 billion, per capita $800; real growth rate
    9% (1991)

:Paraguay Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
    about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five
    years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
    continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a
    major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1991 the government began to more
    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
    domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade
    deficit widened to more than $1 billion. For the long run, the government
    must press forward with general market-oriented economic reforms.

:Peru Government

Long-form name:
    Republic of Peru
Type:
    in transition, President FUJIMORI on 5 April 1992 suspended the constitution
    and dissolved the legislative and judicial branches
Capital:
    Lima
Administrative divisions:
    24 departments (departamentos, singular - departamento) and 1 constitutional
    province* (provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa,
    Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco, Huancavelica, Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La
    Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura,
    Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali; note - the 1979 Constitution and
    legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990 mandate the creation of regions
    (regiones, singular - region) intended to function eventually as autonomous
    economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
    constituted from 23 existing departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres
    Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa),
    Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from Cusco, Madre de
    Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los Libertadores-Huari

    Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin
    (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has
    been delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to

:Peru Economy

Overview:
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
    the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
    output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4% in
    1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
    single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September 1991, and, although it faces $14 billion in arrears on its
    external debt, is working to pay some $1.8 billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by 1993.

:Poland Economy

Overview:
    Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Soviet-style economy -
    with state ownership and control of productive assets - to a market economy.
    On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarity-led government implemented shock
    therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the money
    supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, and
    restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and
    lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 60% in 1991.
    Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external
    debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994, and
    the private sector grew, accounting for 22% of industrial production and 40%
    of nonagricultural output by 1991. Production fell in state enterprises,
    however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
    in 1989 to 11.4% in December 1991. Poland fell out of compliance with its
    IMF program by mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The
    increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
    discontent and a change in government in January 1991 and again in December.
    The new government has promised selective industrial intervention, some
    relaxation in monetary policy, and an improved social safety net, but will
    be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit.

    purchasing power equivalent - $162.7 billion, per capita $4,300; real growth

    Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the EC in 1986
    - at least 4% each year through 1990 - it remains one of the poorest
    members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
    restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
    privatization program. The global slowdown and tight monetary policies to

:Puerto Rico Economy

Overview:
    Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region.
    Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
    activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax
    incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
    Important new industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
    petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
    production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the
    agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of
    income for the island. The economy has largely recovered from the
    disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism
    infrastructure has been especially hard hit.
GNP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $21.6 billion, per capita $6,600; real growth
    rate 2.2% (FY90)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    1.3% (October 1990-91)
Unemployment rate:
    15.5% (October 1991)
Budget:
    revenues $5.8 billion; expenditures $5.8 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $258 million (FY89)

:Reunion Economy

Overview:
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been
    the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for
    85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
    industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third
    of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
    population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
    African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
    well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
    France.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $3.37 billion, per capita $6,000 (1987 est.);
    real growth rate 9% (1987 est.)

:Romania Economy

Overview:
    Industry, which accounts for about one-third of the labor force and
    generates over half the GDP, suffers from an aging capital plant and
    persistent shortages of energy. The year 1991 witnessed about a 17% drop in
    industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
    unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
    flooding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the
    dismantling of cooperatives. A shortage of fuel and equipment in 1991
    contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and
    a poor distribution system. The new government is loosening the tight
    central controls of CEAUSESCU'S command economy. It has instituted moderate
    land reforms, with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and
    it has liberalized private agricultural output. Also, the new regime is
    permitting the establishment of private enterprises, largely in services,
    handicrafts, and small-scale industry. A law providing for the privatization
    of large state firms has been passed. Most of the large state firms have
    been converted into joint-stock companies, but the selling of shares and
    assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has halted
    the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency
    export markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. Furthermore, real
    wages in Romania fell about 20% in 1991, contributing to the unrest which
    forced the resignation of ROMAN in September. The new government continues
    to impose price ceilings on key consumer items.

:Russia Economy

Overview:
    Russia, one of the world's largest economies, possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base. Within the now-dismantled USSR, it
    had produced 60% of total output, with 55% of the total labor force and 60%
    of the total capital stock. Russia depends on its world-class deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings. Self-sufficient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about 95 million tons, second only to Japan. Russia's
    machine-building sector - 60% of the old USSR's - lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product. Other major industrial
    sectors - chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and food
    processing - also suffer from quality problems, obsolescent capital
    equipment, and pollution. Consumer goods have had lower priority, and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences. Furthermore, the
    transition to a more market-oriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets; substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.
    Russia inherited 70% of the former USSR's defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
    plants to civilian production. Russia produces almost half of the old USSR's
    farm products, but most warm-climate crops must be imported. Under the old
    USSR, production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
    in a single firm or a single republic. Today, producing units often have
    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply, and the market
    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
    situations are only slowly emerging. Rank-and-file Russians will continue to
    suffer major deprivations in 1992 and beyond before the country begins to
    realize its great economic potential. The comprehensive economic reform
    program enacted in January 1992 faces many economic and political hurdles
    before it will lead to sustained economic growth.

:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
    Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea make up
    80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $2.1 billion, per capita $300; real growth rate
    -6.8% (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    4.2% (1990)

    petroleum products, cement and construction material
  partners:
    US, Belgium, Germany, Kenya, Japan

Agriculture:
    accounts for almost 50% of GDP and about 90% of the labor force; cash crops
    - coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums); main food
    crops - bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes; stock raising; self-sufficiency
    declining; country imports foodstuffs as farm production fails to keep up
    with a 3.8% annual growth in population
Economic aid:
    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $128 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $2.0 billion; OPEC
    bilateral aid (1979-89), $45 million; Communist countries (1970-89), $58
    million; note - in October 1990 Rwanda launched a Structural Adjustment

:Saint Lucia Economy

Overview:
    Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth rate of
    almost 5% because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors. Saint Lucia
    also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by foreign investment
    in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data processing. The
    economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural
    sector is dominated by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic
    droughts and/or tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the
    UK for bananas may end in 1992.

:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France.

:Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview:
    The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
    independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has
    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987
    output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments
    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
    roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
    Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders.

:Senegal Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for about 20% of GDP and provides
    employment for about 75% of the labor force. About 40% of the total
    cultivated land is used to grow peanuts, an important export crop. The
    principal economic resource is fishing, which brought in about $200 million
    or about 25% of total foreign exchange earnings in 1987. Mining is dominated
    by the extraction of phosphate, but production has faltered because of
    reduced worldwide demand for fertilizers in recent years. Over the past 10
    years tourism has become increasingly important to the economy.

:Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview:
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows. The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife. This new state faces major economic problems. First, like the other
    former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and
    manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence, as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations.

    production (sheep and cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo province
    produces fruits, vegetables, tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the
    mountainous pastures of Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat
    husbandry; Montenegro has only a small agriculture sector, mostly near the

:Sierra Leone Economy

Overview:
    The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
    agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
    employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
    accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
    unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
    dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to
    get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
    March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
    efforts to institute economic reforms.

:Singapore Economy

Overview:

    manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived from

    among the highest in Asia. The economy grew at a respectable 6.5% in 1991,

:Slovenia Economy

Overview:
    Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics, with
    a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indeed not far
    below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong
    ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during internecine
    fighting in Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
    former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
    years. The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, has
    led to severe short-term dislocations in production, employment, and trade
    ties. For example, overall industrial production fell 10% in 1991;
    particularly hard hit were the iron and steel, machine-building, chemical,
    and textile industries. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in other republics
    leading to further destruction of long-established trade channels and to an
    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees. As in other former
    Communist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often sputtered not
    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
    rank-and-file people in the transition to a more market-oriented system. The
    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
    yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's
    comparatively well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.

:Somalia Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
    resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
    livestock sector accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production
    generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The main
    export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of
    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Greatly
    increased political turmoil in 1991-92 has resulted in a substantial drop in
    output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.

:South Africa Economy

Overview:
    Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
    skills, and barriers to movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.
    Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short of
    the 5% to 6% level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor
    force annually. Economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups.

:Spain Economy

Overview:
    Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. In accordance with its
    accession treaty, Spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital
    markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4%
    per year. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
    fight inflation - around 7% in 1989 and 1990. As a result growth slowed to
    2.5% in 1991. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation - still
    hovering at 6%. Government officials also are worried about 16%
    unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the
    underground economy. Spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
    due to the ongoing integration of the European market are likely to lead to
    more displaced workers.

:Sudan Economy

Overview:
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
    weather, high inflation, and counterproductive economic policies. The
    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 70%
    of new investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are
    agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment predating
    1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work
    force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic
    performance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining annual
    rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A high
    foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the
    International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan
    noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. Despite
    subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the
    World Bank, the economy remained stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the
    incentive to take economic risks.

:Suriname Economy

Overview:
    The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for about
    70% of export earnings and 40% of tax revenues. The economy has been in
    trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
    bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986
    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
    crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since
    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990
    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
    economic reform. High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market
    activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $1.4 billion, per capita $3,400; real growth rate
    0% (1989 est.)

Overview:

    exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,
    Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies
    still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are
    essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs
    nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local
    services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some
    trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

:Swaziland Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies most of the
    labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, which includes
    a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP.
    Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore
    deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for
    asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of
    hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
    Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it
    receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.

:Sweden Economy

Overview:

    essentially full employment, a modern distribution system, excellent
    internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
    hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
    heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for
    about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for
    50% of output and exports. In the last few years, however, this
    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation, growing
    absenteeism, and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets.
    The new center-right government, facing a sagging economic situation which
    is unlikely to improve until 1993, is pushing full steam ahead with economic
    reform proposals to end Sweden's recession and to prepare for possible EC
    membership in 1995. The free-market-oriented reforms are designed to spur
    growth, maintain price stability, lower unemployment, create a more
    efficient welfare state, and further adapt to EC standards. The measures
    include: cutting taxes, particularly the value-added tax (VAT) and levies on
    new and small business; privatization; liberalizing foreign ownership
    restrictions; and opening the welfare system to competition and private
    alternatives, which the government will still finance. Growth is expected to
    remain flat in 1992, but increase slightly in 1993, while inflation should
    remain around 3% for the next few years. On the down side, unemployment may
    climb to slightly over 4% in 1993, and the budget deficit will reach nearly
    $9 billion in 1992.

:Switzerland Economy

Overview:
    Switzerland's economic success is matched in few other nations. Per capita
    output, general living standards, education and science, health care, and
    diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Economic stability helps promote the
    important banking and tourist sectors. Since World War II, Switzerland's
    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the 1990s,
    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects.
    After 8 years of growth, the economy experienced a mild recession in 1991
    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
    weak international economy. In the second half of 1992, however, Switzerland
    is expected to resume growth, despite inflation and unemployment problems.
    GDP growth for 1992 may be just under 1%, inflation should drop from 5.9% to
    3.5%, and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
    15% to $5 billion, due to increased exports to Germany. Unemployment,
    however, is forecast to rise to 1.6% in 1992, up from 1.3% in 1991 and 0.5%
    in 1990.

:Syria Economy

Overview:
    Syria's state-dominated Ba`thist economy has benefited from the Gulf war,
    increased oil production, good weather, and economic deregulation. Economic
    growth averaged nearly 12% annually in 1990-91, buoyed by increased oil
    production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1991
    provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab,
    European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascus's
    war-related costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears,
    restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian
    purchases. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large
    number of poorly performing public sector firms; investment levels remain
    low; and industrial and agricultural productivity is poor. A major long-term
    concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when
    its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by mid-decade.

:Taiwan Economy

Overview:
    Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government
    guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government ownership of
    some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP has averaged about
    9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster
    and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Agriculture contributes
    about 4% to GNP, down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13
    among major trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are
    steadily being replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
    industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
    Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The tightening of labor markets
    has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.

:Tajikistan Economy

Overview:
    Tajikistan has had the lowest standard of living and now faces the bleakest
    economic prospects of the 15 former Soviet republics. Agriculture is the
    main economic sector, normally accounting for 38% of employment and
    featuring cotton and fruits. Industry is sparse, bright spots including
    electric power and aluminum production based on the country's sizable
    hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of
    metal-cutting machine tools. In 1991 and early 1992, disruptions in food
    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
    throughout the republic. The combination of the poor food supply, the
    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets, and
    political instability have meant that the republic's leadership could make
    little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992.

:Tanzania Economy

Overview:
    Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 47% of GDP,
    provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
    accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
    in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
    International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to
    rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991
    was featured by a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase
    in output of minerals led by gold.

:Thailand Economy

Overview:
    Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, enjoyed a
    year of 8% growth in 1991, although down from an annual average of 11%
    growth between 1987 and 1990. The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
    sector benefited from export-oriented investment. The manufacturing and
    service sectors have accounted for the lion's share of economic growth.
    Thailand's traditional agricultural sector continued to become less
    important to the overall economy in 1991. The trade deficit continued to
    increase in 1991, to $11 billion; earnings from tourism and remittances grew
    marginally as a result of the Gulf War; and Thailand's import bill grew,
    especially for manufactures and oil. The government has followed fairly
    sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the
    fast-moving economy; Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
    in 1991. The government is moving ahead with new projects - especially for
    telecommunications, roads, and port facilities - needed to refurbish the
    country's overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the military's
    shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1992 have caused
    international businessmen to question Thailand's political stability.
    Thailand's general economic outlook remains good, however, assuming the
    continuation of the government's progrowth measures.

:Togo Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts
    for about 35% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the labor force.
    Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together
    account for about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in
    basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
    phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
    exports accounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
    serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the
    past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number
    of economic reform measures, that is, actively encouraging foreign
    investment and attempting to bring revenues in line with expenditures.
    Political unrest throughout 1991, however, has jeopardized the reform
    program and has disrupted vital economic activity.

:Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview:
    Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to emerge from a lengthy
    depression in 1990 and 1991. The economy fell sharply through most of the
    1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector accounts
    for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of GDP. The government, in
    response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures
    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. The economy showed
    signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by rising oil prices.
    Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and produces about 3%
    of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb the large
    numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to diversify its
    export base.

    exchange rate conversion - $4.9 billion, per capita $3,600; real growth rate

:Tunisia Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
    of light manufactures. Following two years of drought-induced economic
    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for
    the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its
    IMF-supported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
    debt.

:Turkey Economy

Overview:
    The impressive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that Turkey
    launched in 1980 have begun to peter out. Although real growth in per capita
    GDP averaged 5% annually between 1983 and 1988, recent economic performance
    has fallen substantially. Moreover, inflation and interest rates remain
    high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a
    country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled
    to a free market economy. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,
    employing about half of the work force, accounting for 18% of GDP, and
    contributing 19% to exports. The government has launched a
    multibillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which
    includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
    generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned
    tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious
    concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq. The Turkish
    economy emerged from the Gulf War of early 1991 in stronger shape than
    Ankara had expected. Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt
    primarily in the politically sensitive southeast, aid pledges by the
    coalition allies of more than $4 billion have helped offset the burden.

:Turkmenistan Economy

Overview:
    Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
    problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based central
    planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, local
    government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process
    requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and
    monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily
    weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas
    and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
    republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,
    where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.

:Tuvalu Economy

Overview:
    Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil.
    The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence
    farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are too
    small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
    revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
    remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
    trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
    supported also by Japan and South Korea.

:Uganda Economy

Overview:
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
    rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
    been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
    civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
    income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
    does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the
    economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export
    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
    reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing petroleum
    prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially
    aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in 1987, and
    boosting production and export earnings. During the period 1990-91, the
    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
    rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
    exports, and gradually improving domestic security.

:Ukraine Economy

Overview:
    Because of its size, geographic location, Slavic population, and rich
    resources, the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political,
    military, and economic power of the USSR. After Russia, the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
    of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
    well-developed and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR. In
    early 1992 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
    reforms preclude a near-term recovery of output.

:United Kingdom Economy

Overview:
    The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers, and
    its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy is
    essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
    programs and government ownership. Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the
    basic thrust of THATCHER's efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
    and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
    Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European
    standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor
    force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
    about 27% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an
    energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary
    energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
    industrial nation. In mid-1990 the economy fell into recession after eight
    years of strong economic expansion, which had raised national output by one
    quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which has been consistently well above
    those of her major trading partners, declined significantly in 1991. Between
    1986 and 1990 unemployment fell from 11% to about 6%, but crept back up to
    8% in 1991 because of the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the
    UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings
    in the international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,
    and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.

:United States Economy

Overview:
    The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced economy
    in the world, with a per capita GDP of $22,470, the largest among major
    industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the
    longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of
    the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a
    combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,
    Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output failed
    to recover, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.
    Ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
    infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade
    deficits.

:Uruguay Economy

Overview:
    The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early 1980s.
    In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by 1.5%. The recovery was led
    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture alone
    contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11% of the labor force, and
    generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,
    particularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In 1991,
    domestic growth improved somewhat over 1990, but various government factors,
    including concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions,
    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly. In a major step toward greater
    regional economic cooperation, Uruguay joined Brazil, Argentina, and
    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). President
    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
    state intervention in the economy, but he faces strong opposition.

:Uzbekistan Economy

Overview:
    Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet output, it
    produced two-thirds of the USSR's cotton. Moscow's push for ever-increasing
    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused
    extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.
    Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
    pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought
    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial
    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral
    fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some
    important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet production),
    uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
    but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.

:Vietnam Economy

Overview:
    This is a formerly centrally planned, developing economy with extensive
    government ownership and control of productive facilities. The economy is
    primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 70% of the labor force and
    accounts for half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop; substantial amounts of
    maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are also grown. The government
    permits sale of surplus grain on the open market. Most of the mineral
    resources are located in the north, including coal, which is an important
    export item. Oil was discovered off the southern coast in 1986 with
    production reaching 70,000 barrels per day in 1991 and expected to increase
    in the years ahead. Following the end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed
    government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the
    agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
    north. The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
    assistance from UN agencies, France, Australia, Sweden, and Communist
    countries. Inflation, although down from recent triple-digit levels, is
    still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again.
    Per capita output is among the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the
    government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
    economic activity over to the private sector.

:West Bank Header

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

    West Bank will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties.
    These negotiations will determine how the area is to governed.

:West Bank Economy

Overview:
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah).
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
    policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
    industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake
    of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
    Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of
    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to
    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
    standards. The area's economic outlook remains bleak.

:World Economy

Overview:
    Aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1.3%, in contrast to estimated
    2% growth in 1990 and 3% growth in 1989. In 1991, the developed countries
    grew by 2.5% and the LDCs by 3.5%, these gains being offset by a 10-15% drop
    in the former Communist-dominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As
    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed
    group, Japan led with 4.5%, the West European members averaged 1.2%, and the
    recession-plagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7%. As for the 15
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a
    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.

Industries:
    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in
    computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical
    equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small
    portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid
    development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

:World Economy

Agriculture:
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
    20 years. The annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,
    from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains
    malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
    for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for
    food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
    recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors

:Yemen Economy

Overview:
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
    the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
    economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
    on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemen's
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support.
Overview:
  North:
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has
    become a major importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton, fruit,
    and vegetables - has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic
    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export
    revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about
    $800 million.
  South:
    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per capita GNP of
    about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely dispersed population,
    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult. The economy
    has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3% since the mid-1970s. The
    economy had been organized along socialist lines, dominated by the public
    sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly
    stemming from centralized control over production decisions, investment
    allocation, and import choices.

:Zaire Economy

Overview:
    In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP per capita of
    only about $260, putting it among the desperately poor African nations. The
    country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with copper and cobalt
    production down 20-30%, inflation near 8,000% in 1991 as compared with 100%
    in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended until the
    institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,
    employs 75% of the population but generates under 25% of GDP. The main
    potential for economic development has been the extractive industries.
    Mining and mineral processing account for about one-third of GDP and
    three-quarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the world's largest
    producer of diamonds and cobalt.

:Zambia Economy

Overview:
    The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with falling imports
    and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a sustained drop
    in copper production and ineffective economic policies. In 1991 real GDP
    fell by 2%. An annual population growth of more than 3% has brought a
    decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the past decade. A high inflation rate
    has also added to Zambia's economic woes in recent years.

:Zimbabwe Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40%
    of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for
    only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
    account for about 40% of exports. Wide year-to-year fluctuations in
    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
    growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3% annual increase in
    population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program,
    output rose 3.5% in 1991. A drought beginning toward the end of 1991
    suggests rough going for 1992.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order
administrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on
by BGN are noted.  

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of
all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,
excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas
are based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the
entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with
Washington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or the Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2,
0.23 miles2, 146 acres).

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000
population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.

Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1992
was used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates
for 1 July 1992, with population growth rates estimated for mid-1992 through
mid-1993. Major political events have been updated through 30 June 1992.
Military age figures are for 1992.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000
population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with
176 nations (the US has not yet established full diplomatic relations with
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia). The US has diplomatic
relations with 167 of the 178 UN members - the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan,
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Slovenia,
and Vietnam. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 9 nations
that are not in the UN - Andorra, Kiribati, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino,
Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vatican City.

Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that range from
traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or
another. Every international land boundary dispute in the ``Guide to Interna-
tional Boundaries,'' a map published by the Department of State, is included.
References to other situations may also be included that are border or
frontier relevant, such as maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or
irredentist issues. However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute
official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official develop-
ment assistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are
administered with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs
as their main objective and are concessional in character and contain a
grant element of at least 25%, and other official flows (OOF) or transactions
by the official sector whose main objective is other than development
motivated or whose grant element is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF
transactions include official export credits (such as Eximbank credits),
official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the
official sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to 
have been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and 
constitute a formal declaration of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others
are not officially recognized by the US Government. ``Nation'' refers to a
people politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
``Dependent'' area refers to a broad category of political entities that are
associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually
the short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The
long-form name is included in the ``Government'' section, and an entry of
``none'' indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some instances, no
short-form name exists - then the long-form name must serve for all usages.

note: The US Government does not recognize the four so-called independent
homelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and services produced
domestically.

Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and services produced
domestically plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by foreigners
from domestic production.

GNP/GDP methodology: In the ``Economy'' section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for
the OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy.
In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing
for the quality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP
conversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the US as one thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate - will buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the
LDCs, on the other hand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates. One
caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GNP/GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures;
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the
PPP method, we hope to convert all GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future
editions of The World Factbook.

Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance
of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or
negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These
categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as
well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.

Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish
(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant
cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds
and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include
chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide
(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).

Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional,
or behavioral change in an individual.

Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results
in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.

Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and
emotion.

Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,
buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,
angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others
(psilocybin, psilocyn).

Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).

Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,
opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium
(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol
w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and thebaine. Semisynthetic
narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).
Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),
methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).

Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium
poppy.

Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that
is chewed or drunk as tea.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,
Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in
a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land - land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize,
rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted
after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures - land
permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland - land
under dense or open stands of trees; and other - any land type not specifi-
cally mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The percentage figure for
irrigated land refers to the portion of the entire amount of land area that
is artificially supplied with water.

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved
with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head of government is
the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the
government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime
Minister is the head of government. In the US, the President is both the
chief of state and the head of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group
of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains
constant in the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy.
Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition -
the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards
that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is
beyond the scope of this publication.

Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version for the fore-
seeable future.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being fully extended.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial
vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing
vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by
nationality or register.

Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession,
or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent
of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag
as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the
maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the
nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be
owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.

Flag of convenience register - A national register offering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience
(FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or
nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC
registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered
actually owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used
for ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where
the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad.
It is also referred to as an open register.

Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad.
Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned
and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.

Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation
of profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the
flag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable
examples of an internal register.
Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to
flags of convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian
and Danish flags.

Merchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight;
commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to
commercial vessels only.

Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with
the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality
and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag
state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless
otherwise indicated.

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear
population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net
immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per
woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore
children according to a given fertility rate at each age.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as
fiscal year (FY).

The Handbook of International Economic and Environmental Statistics,
published annually in September by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains
detailed economic information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) countries, Eastern Europe, the newly independent
republics of the former nations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and
selected other countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever The World
Factbook is available.

Metric Interrelationships
Conversions from a multiple or submultiple to the basic units of meters,
liters, or grams can be done using the table. For example, to convert from
kilometers to meters, multiply by 1,000 (9.26 kilometers equals 9,260
meters) or to convert from meters to kilometers, multiply by 0.001 (9,260
meters equals 9.26 kilometers)
